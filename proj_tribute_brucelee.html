            The truth is Lee was a formidable opponent with a chiseled physique and technique. 
            I totally enjoyed sparring and just spending time with him. 
            He was as charismatic and friendly in the ring and at home as he 
            was on film. His confidence and wit were dazzling, and sometimes 
            even debilitating to others.
